## Steps Followed

Step 1: Loaded the dataset into Power BI Desktop (CSV format).

Step 2: Used Power Query Editor to clean the data and check for missing values.

Step 3: Applied transformations such as filtering, renaming columns, and handling null values.

Step 4: Created new calculated columns and measures using DAX for better insights.

Step 5: Designed KPI Cards for key metrics:

Average Age of Users

Average Swipes per User

Active Users %


Step 6: Added filters (slicers) for Age, Gender and Frequency of Usage.

Step 7: Created visualizations to showcase user trends and preferences.

Step 8: Designed a dark-themed dashboard with a gradient background (Blue-Red) for an elegant and modern look.

Step 9: Published the report to Power BI Service.
